          To support early partners and build high-quality case studies,
          Flowtica is offering a limited number of
          <strong>AI workflow programs</strong> at a preferred early-partner
          rate. These engagements are designed for organisations that can move
          quickly, provide real-world feedback, and are open to sharing
          non-sensitive results.

        <h3>6-Month AI Workflow Program</h3>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          We take full ownership of one critical workflow for six months – from
          design and build to production reliability and ongoing optimisation.
        </p>
        <p class="offer-price">
          <strong>$6,000 CAD / month</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          6-month minimum engagement. Limited early-partner spots.
        </p>
        <ul class="demo-list">
          <li>
            <strong>One production-ready workflow</strong> – we map your current
            process and implement a robust AI workflow integrated with your
            existing tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Live in weeks, not quarters</strong> – our goal is to get a
            first version into production quickly so most of the engagement is
            spent tuning based on real usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ongoing ownership for six months</strong> – monitoring,
            debugging, and making sensible adjustments as your data, tools, and
            policies evolve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Measurable business impact</strong> – we agree on success
            metrics up front (for example hours saved, tickets handled, or
            response times) and revisit them together during the engagement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          Best suited for teams that have one obvious, painful process and want
          it to simply <em>work</em> in production – not as an experiment but as
          part of day-to-day operations.

          For organisations whose needs don’t fit neatly into the standard

          <strong>Custom pricing</strong>

          <li>
            Exploratory pilots to validate a specific AI workflow in a limited
            part of your operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Multi-workflow or multi-team automation roadmaps, scoped to avoid
            unnecessary complexity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engagements that need different contract structures or procurement
            terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clear success criteria, timeline, and decision points for expanding
            into the standard 6-month program.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          If your situation is unusual, share your context and constraints and
          we’ll recommend the smallest sensible engagement that can prove real
          value while keeping future options open.
