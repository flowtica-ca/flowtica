          Flowtica offers <strong>AI workflow programs</strong> that start with a low-risk assessment and MVP,
          then scale into full production delivery. Ship quickly, measure impact, and keep improving what’s live.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work best with partners who can move quickly and provide feedback.
          For hands-on delivery, we work with a small number of partners at a time.

        <h3>Free Workflow Assessment &amp; 2-Week MVP Build</h3>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          <strong>Kickstart your AI project with no long-term commitment.</strong> We begin with a free assessment of
          one of your workflows to identify a high-impact automation opportunity. Then, in just 2 weeks, we build
          a functional AI MVP tailored to that use case so you can see real results fast.

          Validate value quickly and decide, with evidence, whether to expand into full production.

        <p class="offer-tagline"><strong>What you get in the MVP:</strong></p>
        <ul class="demo-list">
          <li>A working workflow in your environment (not a slide deck)</li>
          <li>Integrated with 1–2 systems (e.g., email + helpdesk/CRM)</li>
          <li>Basic logging + error handling</li>
          <li>A short handoff doc: how it works, how to operate it, next improvements</li>

      <div class="offer-card padd-15">
        <h3>6-Month AI Workflow Program</h3>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          <strong>Scale up your AI solution with a full-production engagement.</strong> After a successful MVP, this
          6-month program fully implements and maintains an AI workflow in production. We take end-to-end
          ownership of one critical process – design, build, launch, and ongoing optimization – to ensure
          long-term success.
        </p>

        <p class="offer-price">
          <strong>Minimum $6,000 CAD / month • 6-month minimum • dedicated delivery</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="offer-tagline">
          One production workflow live in weeks, then improved month over month. Built for reliability, not a demo.
        </p>

        <ul class="demo-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Design + integrate</strong> — map the process and connect to your existing tools (ticketing, CRM,
            email/phone, internal systems), including real edge cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Launch in weeks</strong> — ship a first production version early, then iterate based on real usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operate + improve</strong> — monitoring, logging, retries, alerting, plus regular reviews tied to
            agreed metrics (hours saved, cycle time, SLA, error rate).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="offer-tagline"><strong>How we keep delivery predictable:</strong></p>
        <ul class="demo-list">
          <li>One workflow at a time</li>
          <li>Clear system boundaries</li>
          <li>Changes handled through defined next steps</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="offer-tagline">
          <strong>Best suited for</strong> teams with one painful, mission-critical process that must work reliably in
          day-to-day operations.

      <!-- Offer 2: Custom / By Request -->
      <div class="offer-card padd-15">
        <h3>Custom Scope (By request)</h3>
        <p class="offer-tagline">
          If your needs are unusual, we can design a tailored engagement. This is typically used when the workflow
          touches multiple teams, requires procurement/security reviews, or needs a different contract structure.
        </p>

        <p class="offer-price">
          <strong>Custom pricing</strong>
          <span class="offer-note">scoped after a short call</span>
        </p>

        <ul class="demo-list">
          <li>Focused pilots to validate feasibility before a larger rollout.</li>
          <li>Multi-workflow roadmaps, sequenced to avoid unnecessary complexity.</li>
          <li>Security or compliance reviews aligned with your internal process.</li>
          <li>Clear scope, timeline, and success criteria agreed up front.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="offer-tagline">
          Share your workflow, tools, and constraints; we’ll recommend the smallest sensible engagement that can prove
          value and keep future options open.
