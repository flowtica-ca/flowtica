                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                  Many organizations in Canada are interested in AI but are
                  overwhelmed by tooling, buzzwords, and one-off experiments.
                  Operational teams already feel the pain of manual work,
                  scattered information, and decisions buried in documents or
                  people’s heads. They don’t necessarily want another platform –
                  they want help turning AI into reliable infrastructure.
                </p>

                <h3>What this engagement focuses on</h3>
                <p>
                  In this example, Flowtica works as an
                  <strong>AI consultant in Canada</strong> for an
                  operations-heavy team. The goal is to design and implement a
                  concrete system – such as an internal assistant or workflow –
                  rather than a generic “AI strategy”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Typical questions we help answer with the system include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    “How do we route and answer routine questions consistently,
                    without creating more tools for staff?”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “How do we let people self-serve answers from our policies
                    and procedures without losing control?”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “How can AI draft structured tickets, emails, or summaries
                    that our team can quickly review and approve?”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    “How do we monitor and improve this over time instead of
                    running a one-off pilot?”
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
                <p>
                  The diagram below shows a high-level pattern we reuse across
                  different consulting engagements. It stays tool-agnostic so it
                  can work with your existing stack and can evolve over time.

                <h3>How the consulting process behaves in practice</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    We start by mapping a specific workflow or assistant use
                    case, including inputs, decisions, and handoffs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We design how the workflow engine and language model should
                    interact with your tools, where to retrieve context, and
                    when to involve humans.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We implement a first version that runs in a controlled
                    environment, with logging and clear ways to review model
                    outputs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Together with your team, we iterate on prompts, routing, and
                    UI so the system fits into day-to-day work instead of
                    sitting on the side.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Data ownership &amp; deployment model</h3>
                <p>
                  We avoid locking you into a single, opaque stack. As much as
                  possible, the deployment follows these principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The workflow layer runs in your cloud account or on a
                    dedicated, isolated instance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The system connects to your existing tools and document
                    stores, rather than copying everything into a new platform.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The choice of language model provider can be revisited later
                    without redesigning the entire system.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements, vendor
                  options, or internal policies without starting from scratch.
                </p>

                <h3>Where Flowtica fits in</h3>
                <p>
                  As an AI consultant in Canada, Flowtica’s role is to work with
                  your team to identify the right starting point, design the
                  underlying architecture, and then implement and operate the
                  system until it behaves like part of your infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We focus on a small number of high-impact workflows, document
                  our choices, and keep the system observable so your team can
                  own it in the long run.
                </p>
