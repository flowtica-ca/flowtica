                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                  As organisations grow, it becomes harder for employees to know
                  where to find the latest policy or HR information. Handbooks,
                  PDFs, and wiki pages live in multiple places, and HR teams spend
                  time answering the same questions repeatedly.
                </p>

                <h3>What this copilot does</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica designs an internal assistant that helps employees
                  self-serve answers to policy and HR questions, grounded in your
                  official documentation. Employees can ask natural language
                  questions like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>&ldquo;What is our parental leave policy?&rdquo;</li>
                  <li>&ldquo;How do I submit an expense for this trip?&rdquo;</li>
                  <li>&ldquo;What is the process for changing my working hours?&rdquo;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The copilot responds with answers linked directly to the
                  relevant sections of your policies, and knows when to hand off
                  to HR instead of improvising.
                </p>

                <h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
                <p>
                  The pattern is similar to our other document-centric workflows:
                  a private workflow engine keeps an index of your policies and
                  mediates between employees and a language model.
                </p>

                <h3>How it behaves in practice</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    An employee asks a question in their usual tool (for example,
                    an internal chat channel connected to the copilot).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The workflow engine retrieves the most relevant parts of the
                    policies and sends them, with the question, to the language
                    model.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The model returns an answer that cites which documents were
                    used; the copilot shows both the answer and the policy links.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the question is outside documented policy or marked as
                    sensitive, the workflow routes it to HR with a summary instead
                    of answering directly.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Data ownership &amp; deployment model</h3>
                <p>
                  Your policy documents stay where they are today, shared drives,
                  internal wikis, or document management systems. The workflow
                  engine that monitors and indexes them runs in an environment you
                  control, and only small, relevant snippets are sent to the
                  language model provider you choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means you can revise your policies, change model providers,
                  or add new categories (for example, IT or compliance) without
                  redesigning the system from scratch.
                </p>

                <h3>Where we fit in</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica helps you choose the right scope for an initial
                  deployment, often HR or a specific policy domain, and then expand
                  gradually. We focus on making the assistant observable,
                  maintainable, and predictable, so it behaves like a part of your
                  internal infrastructure rather than a one-off pilot.
