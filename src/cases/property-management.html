                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                  Property management teams often have information spread across
                  leases, building manuals, email threads, ticketing systems, and
                  internal documents. Coordinators and managers spend time
                  re-answering similar questions and manually stitching together
                  context.
                </p>

                <h3>What this assistant does</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica designs a private operations assistant that helps your
                  team answer building and workflow questions quickly and
                  consistently. Instead of browsing folders or asking a colleague,
                  your team can ask:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>&ldquo;What are the quiet hours in Building C?&rdquo;</li>
                  <li>&ldquo;What is the pet policy for new tenants?&rdquo;</li>
                  <li>
                    &ldquo;How do we handle an after-hours elevator outage in this
                    building?&rdquo;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    &ldquo;Which vendor is responsible for HVAC maintenance at this
                    property?&rdquo;
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The assistant responds with grounded answers and links back to
                  the underlying documents or procedures, and can also draft
                  structured maintenance tickets for your existing system.
                </p>

                <h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
                <p>
                  The diagram below shows the high-level pattern we use. It is
                  intentionally tool-agnostic: the same approach works whether your
                  documents live in shared drives, a DMS, or other repositories,
                  and whether you prefer one language model provider or another.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3>How it behaves in practice</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A coordinator asks a free-text question, such as:
                    &ldquo;Tenant in unit 804 reports water coming from the
                    ceiling. What should we do?&rdquo;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The workflow engine retrieves the relevant sections from your
                    emergency procedures and building notes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A language model drafts a step-by-step plan grounded in those
                    documents and cites where each step came from.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The workflow prepares a draft work order with building, unit,
                    category, and suggested urgency, ready for human approval in
                    your existing system.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Data ownership &amp; deployment model</h3>
                <p>
                  We avoid tying you to a single, opaque stack. Instead, we deploy
                  a small workflow engine in an environment that you control:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    either in your own cloud account, or on an isolated hosted
                    instance dedicated to you;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    connected to your existing document storage and ticketing
                    tools;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    using a language model provider you are comfortable with,
                    which can be changed later if needed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Your documents remain in your environment. The assistant only
                  sends the minimum necessary text snippets to the model, and the
                  workflow can be inspected, monitored, and adjusted over time.
                </p>

                <h3>Where we fit in</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica’s role is to work with your team to define which
                  questions matter most, which documents are considered
                  authoritative, and how the assistant should behave when it is
                  not confident. We then design, implement, and operate the
                  workflow so that it behaves like part of your infrastructure,
                  not a one-off experiment.
