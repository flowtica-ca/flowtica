                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                  Clinics, trades, and other appointment-based businesses juggle
                  phone calls, emails, and website messages throughout the day.
                  Staff are interrupted to answer routine questions, and important
                  enquiries can be lost in voicemail or unstructured inboxes.
                </p>

                <h3>What this workflow does</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica designs a reception and intake workflow that captures
                  the essential information from each contact, answers common
                  questions, and delivers structured requests into the tools your
                  team already uses. The focus is on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>fewer missed calls and messages,</li>
                  <li>cleaner intake data, and</li>
                  <li>a simple way to prioritise who needs a call-back.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
                <p>
                  The workflow sits between your channels and your internal tools.
                  It is built so you can choose the telephony or chat providers,
                  and change them later if needed.

                <h3>How it behaves in practice</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A caller phones outside of peak hours or when staff are busy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The assistant clearly introduces itself as an automated
                    system, asks a small set of questions you define, and answers
                    simple, factual queries (such as opening hours or location).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At the end, the workflow creates a structured summary: who
                    called, how to contact them, why they called, and how urgent
                    it is.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That summary is delivered into your ticketing tool, CRM, or
                    internal chat, where your team can respond and update the
                    record.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Data ownership &amp; deployment model</h3>
                <p>
                  The workflow engine runs on a small private server that is
                  either inside your cloud environment or on a dedicated hosted
                  instance for your organisation. We connect it to the telephony
                  and chat providers you already use, and to your downstream
                  systems, without locking you into a single vendor stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only the information required to handle the interaction is
                  passed to the language model provider you select. The rest of
                  the orchestration and data storage stays inside your environment,
                  where your normal access controls and retention policies apply.
                </p>

                <h3>Where we fit in</h3>
                <p>
                  Flowtica works with you to define what &ldquo;good intake&rdquo;
                  looks like: which questions to ask, which topics the assistant
                  can safely handle, and where humans should always be in the
                  loop. We then implement and iterate the workflow so it becomes a
                  reliable part of your operations, not a one-off experiment.
