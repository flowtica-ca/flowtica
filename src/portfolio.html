                <p class="portfolio-note">
                  Flowtica works best when AI is treated as part of your
                  operations stack, not as a stand-alone chatbot. The examples
                  below show how we partner with teams in large, document-heavy
                  and operations-heavy environments—without exposing every
                  implementation detail. Each example links to a dedicated page
                  with a diagram and a deeper explanation of the AI workflows
                  behind it.

                    <p>
                      A private AI assistant for property management and condo /
                      strata teams that answers questions about buildings,
                      tenants, and procedures from a single place instead of
                      scattered files and inboxes. The workflow connects to your
                      existing systems so answers stay aligned with your actual
                      data and documents.

                      An AI-powered reception workflow that answers routine

                      sure fewer calls and messages are lost when staff are
                      busy. It can support phone, web chat, or both, and hand

                      An internal AI assistant that helps employees self-serve

                      of repetitive requests while keeping answers aligned with

                      This pattern is reusable across many domains: HR, IT,

                      assistant, all running within the same private workflow
                      environment and tailored to their documents.

                  All three examples are built on a common idea: use a private
                  workflow engine, connected to your existing systems, to keep
                  an up-to-date view of your documents and processes, and let a
                  language model reason over that context in a controlled way.
                  The exact tools and vendors can change; the architecture and
                  data ownership model stay in your favour.
